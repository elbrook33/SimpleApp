NanoDoc
=======

NanoDoc is a rich-text editor (library) based on NanoVG.

Features
--------

* Editable Markdown.
* Customisable style rules.
* Effectively an HTML/CSS - but pure GL (and _much_ simpler than a web browser).

Later
-----

* Nested documents for complex layouts. <docname>
* Custom actions for various UI events. (ltdl)

Why
---

An alternative to web apps: build apps with Markdown layouts and pure C code; a building block for a rich-text code editor; another attempt at elegance in computing.
